# Springboard-Hospital-Readmission-Exercise

This exercise uses hospital readmissoin data from 2012 from https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmissions-Reduction-Program/9n3s-kdb3 to determine whether excess rates of readmission to hospitals have anything to do with the number of discharges from that hospital over a three month time period.

The exploration includes hypothesis testing, frequentist testing, and a linear regression to help see if there is a significant trend or not. 

It was found that there was a downwards trend but the rate of change was so small that it was recommended that the trend not be used to determine future hospital policies.
